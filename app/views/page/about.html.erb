    <p>The Old Crown Brass Band’s inaugural concert was cancelled; a casualty of a December snow storm in 2007!  Undeterred, this group of musicians from disparate backgrounds regrouped and, since that time, has gained a faithful following of fans who have come to appreciate both the quality of music and the unique sound of a British Brass Band.</p>
    <p>OCBB is based in Fort Wayne, IN although its members are drawn from a three-state area. They include professional musicians (from two major symphony orchestras), music educators, music-industry professionals and plain fun-loving amateurs.</p>
    <p>The idea for the band was conceived by a group of brass players who were inspired to name the band after a certain beverage brewed by the now-defunct, but oft remembered, Centlivre Brewing Company, Old Crown Ale.</p>
    <p>A British Brass Band differs from other brass bands. Reed instruments (such as the saxophone) are excluded while certain brass wind instruments that are rarely found in other types of band (flugelhorns, baritone horns) are included.</p>
    <p>British Brass Bands flourished in the early nineteenth century during the Industrial Revolution. Company owners often formed and funded bands as a “distraction” for workers who might otherwise engage in political activity which was potentially detrimental to the interests of the owners. The popularity of this movement has resulted in a significant repertoire of original compositions for the brass band as well as custom-arrangements of orchestral compositions. Notable contributors of original compositions include Elgar, Malcolm Arnold, Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughn Williams.</p>
    <p>OCBB has a home base at Aldersgate United Methodist Church in Fort Wayne but its regular concert program includes venues throughout NE Indiana and NW Ohio.</p>
